# Installation notes

## Default Configuration

LLDAP is configured using the default options generated by the application on first run. The exception to this is the 'Base DN for LDAP' option which has been exposed to the user.

By default, LLDAP will use the following options:

- Admin username: admin
- Admin password: password
- Base DN for LDAP: dc=example,dc=org
- LDAP port: 3890

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: The default configuration is not secure and should not be used in production. Please change the admin password for LDAP before using LLDAP in production. ⚠️

## Usage

LLDAP can be used as the user backend for Authelia and Authentik as well as any other application that supports LDAP e.g. Jellyfin and Nextcloud.

## Support

- If you need more details or have a more custom setup the documentation on the [upstream](https://github.com/ldap/ldap) is very useful so check the descriptions of the options there including example configs for various apps.
- You can also reach us using [Discord](https://discord.gg/tVsPTHWTtr) for real-time feedback and support
