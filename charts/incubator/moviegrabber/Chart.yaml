description: MovieGrabber is a fully automated way of downloading movie from usenet,
  it supports any nzb client that has a "watched" or "monitor" folder facility such
  as Sabnzbd+, Grabit and Newsbin. MovieGrabber works by checking imdb for matching
  criteria and if a match is found the nzb will be downloaded and stored in either
  a specified queued folder for user review or sent to the watched folder for processing
  and automatic downloading via your usenet binary client.
